# Authentication System Bugfix - 2025-03-05

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Validation Schema Missing Username Field
- **Problem**: The `userRegistration` schema in `schemas.js` was missing the required `username` field that was expected by the `registerUser` function.
- **Solution**: Added the username field to the userRegistration schema.

### 2. Error in User Existence Check
- **Problem**: The register endpoint was failing with error "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'or')" because the code was trying to use Sequelize's `Op.or` operator incorrectly.
- **Solution**: Split the user existence check into two separate queries - one for email and one for username.

### 3. Validation Error Handling
- **Problem**: The validation middleware was not properly formatting validation errors in a way that the client could easily parse and display.
- **Solution**: Enhanced the validation middleware to better parse and format Joi validation errors, providing more specific error messages per field.

## Changes Made

1. Updated `app/server/src/services/validation/schemas.js`:
   - Added `username` field to the `userRegistration` schema

2. Modified `app/server/src/middleware/validation.js`:
   - Improved error response handling
   - Added better parsing of validation errors
   - Enhanced error messages to be more specific about each field's validation issues

3. Updated `app/server/src/services/authService.js`:
   - Replaced the problematic `[Op.or]` query with separate queries for email and username
   - Enhanced error messages to be clearer about whether the email or username is already taken

## Other Considerations

- The client should now receive more specific validation errors that can be displayed to the user
- Each field can have its own error message
- This implementation should be more robust against null/undefined errors

## Future Improvements

- Consider adding more comprehensive server-side validation
- Add client-side form validation that mirrors the server validation rules
- Implement more detailed logging of validation failures for debugging
