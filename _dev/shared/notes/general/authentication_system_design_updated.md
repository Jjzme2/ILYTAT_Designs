# ILYTAT Designs Authentication System Design

## Architecture Overview

The authentication system follows a standard client-server architecture with JWT-based authentication:

### Client-Side Components
- **AuthStore (Pinia)** - Central state management for authentication
- **Login/Register Views** - User interface for authentication
- **Axios Configuration** - Handles API requests with token management
- **Router Guards** - Protect routes based on authentication state

### Server-Side Components
- **Auth Routes** - API endpoints for authentication operations
- **Auth Service** - Business logic for authentication
- **Validation Middleware** - Request validation using Joi schemas
- **Error Handling** - Standardized error responses
- **User Model** - Database schema for user information
- **Session Management** - Tracks user sessions across devices
- **Security Utilities** - Password hashing, JWT generation, etc.

## Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**
   - User submits registration form
   - Validation middleware validates input
   - User existence check to prevent duplicates
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - User creation in database
   - Verification token generation
   - Welcome/verification email (optional)
   - JWT generation and response
   - Session creation
   
2. **Login**
   - User submits credentials
   - Validation middleware validates input
   - User lookup by email
   - Password verification with bcrypt
   - JWT generation and response
   - Session creation/update
   - Failed login attempt tracking

3. **Authentication Verification**
   - JWT verification for protected routes
   - Token refresh mechanism
   - Role-based access control

## Error Handling Improvements

The system now includes comprehensive error handling:

1. **Validation Errors**
   - Structured format for field-specific errors
   - Clear, user-friendly messages
   - Consistent response structure

2. **APIResponse Format**
   - Standardized success/error responses
   - Includes request ID for tracking
   - Contains appropriate status codes
   - Sanitizes sensitive information

3. **Request Tracking**
   - Unique request ID generation
   - ID propagation through middleware chain
   - ID included in all logs and responses
   - Header-based tracking (X-Request-ID)

## Security Considerations

- **Password Security**
  - Bcrypt hashing with appropriate salt rounds
  - Minimum password requirements enforced
  - Password reset functionality
  
- **JWT Configuration**
  - Short-lived access tokens
  - Refresh token rotation
  - Token blacklisting for logout
  
- **Rate Limiting**
  - Prevents brute force attacks
  - IP-based and account-based limits
  
- **Logging & Monitoring**
  - Security-focused logging
  - Suspicious activity detection
  - Performance metrics collection

## Recent Bugfixes and Improvements

1. **Validation Schema Fix**
   - Added missing username field to userRegistration schema
   - Enhanced validation error message formatting
   - Improved client-side error handling

2. **User Existence Check Fix**
   - Replaced problematic Sequelize Op.or query
   - Separate checks for email and username uniqueness
   - Clearer error messages for each case

3. **Error Handling Enhancements**
   - Updated error middleware to use APIResponse
   - Consistent error format across the application
   - Better parsing of validation errors

4. **Request Tracing**
   - Added UUID-based request ID generation
   - Included request ID in logs and responses
   - Added X-Request-ID header

5. **Logging Improvements**
   - Enhanced request/response logging
   - Better error logging with context
   - Performance metric collection

## Ongoing Considerations

- Implement comprehensive E2E testing for authentication flows
- Consider adding multi-factor authentication
- Review session management for enhanced security
- Implement more granular role-based permissions
- Add account lockout after multiple failed attempts
