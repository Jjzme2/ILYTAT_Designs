# Authentication System Debugging

## Overview
This document outlines the steps taken to debug and fix the password validation and hashing system in the authentication implementation.

## Issue Description
Users are experiencing login issues, receiving an "Invalid credentials, invalid password" error despite using the correct password.

## Debugging Approach

### 1. Enhanced Logging
We've added comprehensive debug logging throughout the authentication flow to identify exactly where the password validation is failing:

- **User Model (`models/User.js`)**:
  - Added detailed logging in the `validatePassword` method
  - Added checks in the `beforeSave` hook to prevent double-hashing of passwords
  - Logging password hash characteristics during validation

- **Auth Service (`services/authService.js`)**:
  - Added logging in the `validateUserCredentials` method
  - Added logging in the `createUser` method to track password hashing
  - Tracking the entire authentication flow with detailed logs

### 2. Debug Routes
Created dedicated debug routes for testing the authentication system:

- **`POST /api/debug/auth-test`**: Tests the entire authentication flow with a test user
  - Creates a test user if one doesn't exist
  - Tests direct bcrypt comparison
  - Tests the model's validatePassword method
  - Tests the AuthService authentication flow
  - Returns detailed results for analysis

- **`POST /api/debug/hash-password`**: Simple utility to hash a password and return the result
  - Useful for comparing password hashing behavior

### 3. Potential Issues Identified

1. **Double Hashing**: The `beforeSave` hook might be hashing already-hashed passwords during updates
   - Added checks to prevent re-hashing passwords that are already in bcrypt format

2. **Incorrect Password Validation**: The original implementation attempted to "dehash" passwords
   - Fixed to use `bcrypt.compare()` directly

3. **Salt Generation**: Inconsistent salt generation could lead to different hash results
   - Standardized on 10 rounds for salt generation

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the server in development mode
2. Use Postman or any API client to test the debug endpoints:

### Test Authentication Flow
```
POST /api/debug/auth-test
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "TestPassword123!"
}
```

### Test Password Hashing
```
POST /api/debug/hash-password
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "password": "TestPassword123!"
}
```

## Results and Findings

(This section will be updated after running the tests)

## Next Steps

1. Review test results to identify the exact cause of the password validation issue
2. Implement the necessary fixes based on findings
3. Verify the fix by testing with real user credentials
4. Update this documentation with the final solution

## Security Considerations

- These debug routes are only available in development mode
- Ensure all debug code is removed or disabled in production
- Be cautious about logging sensitive information like passwords
- Consider implementing a more robust password policy
