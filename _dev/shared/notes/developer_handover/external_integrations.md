# External Integrations Documentation

**Last Updated:** March 10, 2025

## Overview

ILYTAT Designs integrates with several external services to provide e-commerce functionality. This document details the integration points, configuration requirements, and implementation details for each external service.

## Printify Integration

### Purpose
Printify is used for print-on-demand product fulfillment, allowing ILYTAT Designs to offer custom-designed products without maintaining inventory.

### Integration Points

1. **Product Catalog**
   - Fetches available products and variants from Printify
   - Syncs product data to local database via PrintifyCache model
   - Handles image assets and product metadata

2. **Order Fulfillment**
   - Submits orders to Printify for production and shipping
   - Tracks fulfillment status (processing, shipped, delivered)
   - Handles shipping notifications and tracking information

### Implementation Details

1. **Service Files**
   - `app/server/src/services/printify/PrintifyService.js` - Core API interaction
   - `app/server/src/services/printify/PrintifyCacheService.js` - Caching layer

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `GET /api/products` - Returns cached Printify products
   - `GET /api/products/:id` - Returns specific product details
   - `POST /api/orders/fulfill` - Submits order to Printify

3. **Authentication**
   - Uses API key stored in environment variables
   - Implements rate limiting to avoid API throttling

4. **Caching Strategy**
   - Products cached in PrintifyCache model
   - Cache invalidation based on TTL (Time-To-Live)
   - Manual cache refresh via admin panel

### Error Handling

1. **Retry Mechanism**
   - Exponential backoff for failed API calls
   - Maximum of 3 retry attempts

2. **Fallback Strategy**
   - Uses cached data when API is unavailable
   - Admin notifications for persistent failures

## Stripe Integration

### Purpose
Stripe handles payment processing for customer orders, including checkout sessions, payment intents, and refunds.

### Integration Points

1. **Checkout Process**
   - Creates Stripe checkout sessions
   - Handles successful payments and abandoned carts
   - Processes payment confirmations

2. **Payment Management**
   - Tracks payment status
   - Processes refunds
   - Handles payment disputes

### Implementation Details

1. **Service Files**
   - `app/server/src/services/payment/StripeService.js` - Core payment processing
   - `app/server/src/services/payment/WebhookService.js` - Webhook handlers

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `POST /api/checkout/create-session` - Creates Stripe checkout session
   - `GET /api/checkout/success` - Handles successful checkout
   - `POST /api/webhooks/stripe` - Processes Stripe webhooks

3. **Authentication**
   - Uses Stripe API keys (public/secret) from environment variables
   - Implements webhook signature verification

4. **Event Handling**
   - Listens for `checkout.session.completed` events
   - Updates order status based on payment events
   - Triggers order fulfillment workflow

### Security Considerations

1. **PCI Compliance**
   - Uses Stripe Elements for secure card collection
   - No card data touches application servers

2. **Webhook Verification**
   - Validates webhook signatures
   - Prevents replay attacks with idempotency keys

3. **Environment Separation**
   - Different API keys for development, staging, and production
   - Test mode for development environments

## Email Service Integration

### Purpose
Handles transactional emails for user registration, order confirmations, shipping notifications, and marketing communications.

### Integration Points

1. **User Communications**
   - Account verification
   - Password reset
   - Account notifications

2. **Order Communications**
   - Order confirmations
   - Shipping updates
   - Delivery confirmations

### Implementation Details

1. **Service Files**
   - `app/server/src/services/email/EmailService.js` - Core email functionality
   - `app/server/src/services/email/templates/` - Email templates

2. **Provider**
   - SendGrid API for email delivery
   - Fallback to SMTP for development environments

3. **Template System**
   - Handlebars templates for email content
   - Responsive design for mobile compatibility
   - Localization support

### Configuration

1. **Environment Variables**
   - `EMAIL_API_KEY` - SendGrid API key
   - `EMAIL_FROM` - Default sender address
   - `EMAIL_REPLY_TO` - Reply-to address

2. **Template Customization**
   - Brand colors and logos defined in template variables
   - Customizable footer with legal information

## Development Guidelines

### API Keys and Secrets

1. **Storage**
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use environment variables for all secrets
   - Different keys for each environment

2. **Access Control**
   - Restrict API key access to necessary team members
   - Rotate keys periodically
   - Use least-privilege principle for API permissions

### Testing External Integrations

1. **Mocking**
   - Use mock responses for unit tests
   - Implement test doubles for external services

2. **Sandbox Environments**
   - Use sandbox/test mode for all providers in development
   - Create test accounts for each service

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Dedicated test suite for each external integration
   - Periodic health checks for API endpoints

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **API Rate Limiting**
   - Implement exponential backoff
   - Monitor API usage
   - Cache frequently accessed data

2. **Webhook Failures**
   - Verify webhook URLs are publicly accessible
   - Check signature verification
   - Review webhook logs in provider dashboards

3. **Data Synchronization**
   - Implement reconciliation processes
   - Log synchronization events
   - Provide manual sync options in admin panel
