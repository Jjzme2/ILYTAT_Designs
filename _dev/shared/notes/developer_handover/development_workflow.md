# Development Workflow Documentation

**Last Updated:** March 10, 2025

## Overview

This document outlines the development workflow, coding standards, and best practices for the ILYTAT Designs application. Following these guidelines ensures consistency, maintainability, and high code quality across the codebase.

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or later)
- MySQL (v8.x or later)
- Git
- VS Code (recommended)

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ILYTAT-Designs/ecommerce-platform.git
   cd ILYTAT-Designs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install server dependencies
   cd app/server
   npm install

   # Install client dependencies
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both client and server directories
   - Update values according to your local environment

4. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   cd ../server
   npm run db:create
   npm run db:migrate
   npm run db:seed
   ```

5. **Start the development servers**
   ```bash
   # Start server (from server directory)
   npm run dev

   # Start client (from client directory)
   npm run dev
   ```

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for feature development
- `feature/*` - Feature branches
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fix branches
- `release/*` - Release preparation branches
- `hotfix/*` - Hot fixes for production issues

### Workflow Steps

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make changes and commit**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

3. **Push changes and create a pull request**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Code review and merge**
   - Create a pull request to the `develop` branch
   - Address review comments
   - Merge after approval

### Commit Message Conventions

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` - A new feature
- `fix:` - A bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `test:` - Adding or correcting tests
- `chore:` - Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

## Code Quality Standards

### Principles to Follow

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Extract repeated code into reusable functions or components
   - Use utility functions for common operations

2. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**
   - Favor simplicity over complexity
   - Write code that is easy to understand and maintain

3. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**
   - Don't add functionality until it's necessary
   - Avoid speculative features

4. **SOLID Principles**
   - Single Responsibility Principle
   - Open/Closed Principle
   - Liskov Substitution Principle
   - Interface Segregation Principle
   - Dependency Inversion Principle

5. **Separation of Concerns (SoC)**
   - Clear boundaries between components
   - Modular architecture

6. **Avoid Premature Optimization**
   - Focus on correctness first
   - Optimize only when necessary and after profiling

7. **Law of Demeter**
   - Minimize dependencies between components
   - Reduce coupling

### Code Style and Linting

- ESLint and Prettier are configured for both client and server
- Run linting before commits:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- Format code:
  ```bash
  npm run format
  ```

### Documentation Standards

- **Code Comments**
  - Document complex logic and algorithms
  - Explain "why" rather than "what"
  - Use JSDoc for functions and classes

- **API Documentation**
  - Document all API endpoints
  - Include request/response examples
  - Specify error responses

- **README Files**
  - Each major component should have a README
  - Include usage examples
  - Document configuration options

## Testing Strategy

### Types of Tests

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test individual functions and components
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Focus on business logic

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test interactions between components
   - Verify API contracts
   - Test database operations

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - Test complete user flows
   - Simulate real user interactions
   - Verify system behavior as a whole

### Test Coverage Goals

- Unit tests: 80% coverage
- Integration tests: Key workflows covered
- E2E tests: Critical user journeys covered

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Deployment Process

### Environments

- **Development** - Local development environment
- **Staging** - Pre-production testing environment
- **Production** - Live environment

### Deployment Steps

1. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   # Build server
   cd app/server
   npm run build

   # Build client
   cd ../client
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Run database migrations**
   ```bash
   cd ../server
   npm run db:migrate
   ```

3. **Deploy to target environment**
   - Use CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
   - Deploy server and client separately
   - Verify deployment with smoke tests

### Rollback Procedure

1. Identify the issue requiring rollback
2. Revert to the previous stable version in the CI/CD pipeline
3. Run database migrations if necessary
4. Verify the rollback with smoke tests

## Monitoring and Logging

### Logging Strategy

- **Log Levels**
  - ERROR: Errors that require immediate attention
  - WARN: Warnings that might require attention
  - INFO: Informational messages about system operation
  - DEBUG: Detailed debugging information

- **Log Format**
  - Timestamp
  - Log level
  - Message
  - Context (user ID, request ID, etc.)
  - Stack trace (for errors)

### Monitoring Tools

- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking
- Database performance monitoring
- Server resource monitoring

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Database Connection Issues

1. **Check database service is running**
   ```bash
   # For MySQL
   sudo service mysql status
   ```

2. **Verify connection settings in .env file**
   - Database host, port, username, password
   - Database name

3. **Check for connection pool exhaustion**
   - Review connection pool settings
   - Look for unclosed connections

### Authentication Problems

1. **JWT token issues**
   - Check token expiration
   - Verify token signature
   - Ensure correct secret key in environment variables

2. **Login failures**
   - Check user credentials
   - Verify account status (active, verified)
   - Check for account lockouts

### API Request Failures

1. **Check request format**
   - Verify request body structure
   - Ensure required headers are present

2. **Examine server logs**
   - Look for error messages
   - Check request context

3. **Verify API endpoint configuration**
   - Route definitions
   - Middleware setup
