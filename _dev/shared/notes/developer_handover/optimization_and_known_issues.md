# Optimization and Known Issues

**Last Updated:** March 10, 2025

## Database Optimizations

### Index Optimization

We recently identified and resolved an issue with redundant database indices that was affecting performance:

#### Problem Identified
Multiple indices were being defined in both Sequelize model files and migration files, creating duplicate indices in the database. This redundancy:
- Slowed down write operations
- Consumed unnecessary storage space
- Created maintenance confusion
- Potentially caused conflicts during migrations

#### Affected Models
1. **User Model**
   - Removed redundant indices for `email`, `username`, and `verificationToken`
   - Kept only the `resetPasswordToken` index which wasn't defined in migrations

2. **Session Model**
   - Removed redundant indices for `userId` and `token`
   - These were already defined in the `20250227000006-create-sessions.js` migration

3. **Role Model**
   - Removed redundant indices for `name`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`
   - These were already defined in migrations

4. **Permission Model**
   - Removed redundant indices for `name`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`
   - Indices for `resource` and `action` were only defined in the migration

#### Best Practices Going Forward
- Define indices in **either** models **or** migrations, not both
- Prefer defining structural elements like indices in migrations for explicit control
- Document index locations with comments to prevent confusion
- Review existing indices before adding new ones to avoid duplication

## Performance Considerations

### Database Query Optimization

1. **N+1 Query Problem**
   - Use eager loading with Sequelize `include` option
   - Example: `User.findAll({ include: ['roles'] })` instead of fetching roles separately

2. **Pagination**
   - Implement for all list endpoints
   - Use `limit` and `offset` or cursor-based pagination for large datasets

3. **Selective Column Fetching**
   - Use `attributes` option to select only needed columns
   - Example: `User.findAll({ attributes: ['id', 'email', 'username'] })`

### API Response Optimization

1. **Response Compression**
   - Enabled for all API responses
   - Significantly reduces payload size for large responses

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - API responses cached where appropriate
   - Cache invalidation on related data changes
   - Cache headers properly set for browser caching

3. **Payload Minimization**
   - Remove unnecessary fields from responses
   - Use pagination and filtering to reduce payload size

### Frontend Performance

1. **Bundle Size Optimization**
   - Code splitting implemented for all routes
   - Tree shaking to eliminate unused code
   - Dependency optimization

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Responsive images with appropriate sizes
   - WebP format with fallbacks
   - Lazy loading for off-screen images

3. **Rendering Performance**
   - Virtual scrolling for long lists
   - Debounced event handlers
   - Optimized component re-rendering

## Known Issues

### Authentication System

1. **Token Refresh Mechanism**
   - Current implementation requires manual refresh
   - Future improvement: Implement automatic token refresh

2. **Social Login Integration**
   - Not yet implemented
   - Planned for future release

### Order Processing

1. **Concurrent Order Processing**
   - Potential race conditions during high traffic
   - Implement distributed locking mechanism

2. **Order Status Synchronization**
   - Occasional delays in status updates from Printify
   - Implement webhook reliability improvements

### Product Catalog

1. **Search Performance**
   - Full-text search can be slow for large catalogs
   - Consider implementing Elasticsearch for improved search

2. **Product Variant Selection**
   - UI for selecting multiple variants needs improvement
   - Enhance the variant selection component

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

1. **PII Handling**
   - Personal Identifiable Information is encrypted at rest
   - Access logs track all PII access
   - Regular PII audit implemented

2. **API Security**
   - Rate limiting implemented on all endpoints
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - CSRF protection

### Authentication Security

1. **Password Policies**
   - Minimum password strength requirements
   - Regular password rotation prompts
   - Breached password detection

2. **Session Management**
   - Short-lived access tokens (1 hour)
   - Longer-lived refresh tokens (7 days)
   - Session invalidation on suspicious activity

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Performance Monitoring

1. **Database Query Performance**
   - Slow query logging enabled
   - Query performance dashboard
   - Alerts for queries exceeding thresholds

2. **API Response Times**
   - Endpoint performance tracking
   - 95th percentile response time alerts
   - Request volume monitoring

### Error Tracking

1. **Backend Errors**
   - Centralized error logging
   - Error categorization and prioritization
   - Automatic alerts for critical errors

2. **Frontend Errors**
   - Client-side error tracking
   - User session replay for error context
   - Browser compatibility issues tracking

## Future Optimizations

### Planned Improvements

1. **Database Optimization**
   - Implement database sharding for horizontal scaling
   - Optimize query patterns for frequently accessed data
   - Add read replicas for scaling read operations

2. **Caching Enhancements**
   - Implement Redis for distributed caching
   - Add cache warming for predictable high-traffic events
   - Optimize cache invalidation strategies

3. **Infrastructure Scaling**
   - Containerization with Docker
   - Kubernetes for orchestration
   - Auto-scaling based on traffic patterns

### Technical Debt Items

1. **Code Refactoring Needs**
   - Standardize error handling across services
   - Improve test coverage for critical paths
   - Refactor authentication flow for better maintainability

2. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Enhance API documentation with more examples
   - Create architectural decision records (ADRs)
   - Improve code comments for complex algorithms

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Error Scenarios

1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Check connection pool settings
   - Verify database credentials
   - Examine database server logs

2. **API Timeout Errors**
   - Check for long-running queries
   - Verify third-party service availability
   - Examine request payload size

3. **Authentication Failures**
   - Verify token expiration
   - Check for account lockouts
   - Examine authentication service logs

### Debugging Tools
