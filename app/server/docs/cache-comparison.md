# Cache Implementation Comparison

## Redis vs Node-Cache

### Redis
**Pros:**
- Persistent storage across server restarts
- Distributed caching (works across multiple servers)
- Rich data structure support
- Built-in pub/sub capabilities
- Industry standard for large-scale applications

**Cons:**
- Requires separate service installation
- Additional infrastructure maintenance
- More complex setup and configuration
- Overkill for smaller applications
- Additional system resource usage

### Node-Cache
**Pros:**
- Simple setup (just npm install)
- No external dependencies
- Runs in the same process
- Lightweight memory footprint
- Perfect for single-server applications
- Easy to understand and maintain

**Cons:**
- Data lost on server restart
- Not distributed (only works for single server)
- Limited data structure support
- No built-in pub/sub

## Our Choice: Node-Cache

For our current needs, Node-Cache is the better choice because:
1. Simpler implementation and maintenance
2. No additional infrastructure required
3. Sufficient performance for rate limiting and session management
4. Easy to replace with Redis later if needed
5. Lower development and operational overhead

### Usage Examples:
```javascript
// Rate limiting
cache.set(`login_attempts:${ipAddress}`, attempts, 900); // 15 minutes TTL

// Session management
cache.set(`session:${userId}`, sessionData, 1800); // 30 minutes TTL
```

### Migration Path
If we need to switch to Redis later, we can:
1. Create a cache interface abstraction
2. Implement Redis provider behind the same interface
3. Switch providers with minimal code changes
